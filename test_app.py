The problem is not in accessing the data, it’s in creating an operational model based on data to make effective decisions at scale. Responding to a customer insight at scale is very difficult to do when the view is fragmented across multiple channels, products, touch points and regions. In some scenarios it’s possible to develop a true customer insight orunderstanding but it comes long after it’s relevant - often at the point of trying to understand why a customer was lost. Furthermore developing a personalized customer experience at scale is very difficult when other factors such as old data, disconnected systems and processes and integration complexities are factored into the mix.
